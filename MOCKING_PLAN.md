# Taskcy Mock Data Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for realistic mock data in Taskcy, designed to create an authentic project management experience for demos and development. The data is mutable during runtime but resets on each app launch.

## Data Architecture Strategy

### Storage Approach
- **Non-persistent**: Data lives in memory only, resets on app restart
- **Mutable**: All CRUD operations work during runtime
- **Realistic**: Based on actual development scenarios
- **Demo-optimized**: Strategically timed for effective screen demonstrations

### Service Layer Changes
- Remove SharedPreferences persistence from all local services
- Use static in-memory collections initialized on first access
- Maintain existing service interfaces for seamless integration
- Enable real-time data manipulation without persistence
